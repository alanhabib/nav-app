### Simple nested nav-app with react-router

## There are some Todos for this application:

# TODOs:

- Clean the code base, right now I have used two different styling methods but I will eventually move everything to styled-components.
- I need to styled the nested routing more and render them correctly
- Update all code into TypeScript, right now there some components not in TypeScript.
